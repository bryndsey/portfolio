  `I had never done any programming until college, where I originally went as a Math major. After stumbling into a few encounters with code though, I fell in love and graduated in 2012 with a degree in Computer Science, starting my first dev gig shortly after.`,
  `After a few years working in random tech stacks (X++, anyone?), I took some advice from a co-worker and taught myself Android development. In 2015 landed a job doing mobile development, which was also my initial experience in consulting.`,
  `Exposure to books like "Clean Code" and "Refactoring" evolved my technical skills to "Senior Developer" status. And with each client I worked with, my consulting skills continued to grow.`,
  `A chance encounter led me to learning React, Typescript, and other web tech in my free time starting in 2019, and I later made the switch to full-time web developer.`,
  `I continue to inherit new skills and tools, some of which you can see on display on this website as well as in my projects (and some of which I can't share... NDAs, sorry ðŸ˜”).`,
