  `Growing up, I didn't have a computer at home. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I had never written any computer code until my time at Centre College, where I originally went as a Math major.`,
  `After stumbling into a few encounters with code, I fell in love with development and graduated in 2012 with a degree in Computer Science.`,
  `The first few years of my career were spent fumbling around but landing in places where I could learn and grow. I did enterprise desktop development with C++ and worked on an "ERP" system using... X++ (yeah, don't ask).`,
  `After some random advice from a co-worker, I taught myself Android development and in 2015 landed a job doing Android. In addition to the new tech stack, I also adapted from working at product companies to consulting.`,
  `Exposure to books like "Clean Code" and "Refactoring" evolved my technical skills to "Senior Developer" status.`,
  `A chance encounter led me to learning React in my free time starting in 2019, and I later made the switch to full-time web developer. `,
  `I continue to inherit new skills and tools, some of which you can see on display on this website as well as in my projects (and some of which I can't share... NDAs, sorry ðŸ˜”).`,
