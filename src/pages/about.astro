  `The first few years of my career were spent fumbling around but landing in places where I could learn and grow. I did enterprise desktop development with C++ and worked on an "ERP" system using... X++ (yeah, don't ask).`,
  `After some random advice from a co-worker, I taught myself Android development and in 2015 landed a job doing Android. In addition to the new tech stack, I also adapted from working at product companies to consulting.`,
  `I was also exposed to books like "Clean Code" and "Refactoring", which evolved my technical skills to "Senior Developer" status.`,
  `A chance encounter led me to learning React in my free time starting in 2019, and I later made the switch to full-time web developer. `,

        <p>
          I'm a software engineer<span class="text-stone-500">*</span> focused on
          front-end web development. I've picked up a wide set of skills over my
          career, both technical and non-technical, and continue to adapt effectively
          to new environments and technologies. My favorite animal is the platypus.

        but it lays eggs. It's got a bill and webbed feet like a duck, but it's got
        fur instead of feathers. It's got a tail like a beaver. The playtpus took
        a unique evolutionary path to get to where it is today.

      <p>Am I forcing a metaphor because "platypus" is my favorite animal?</p>

        But, I genuinely think the platypus is a beautiful, intriguing, and
        sometimes underappreciated creature because of the unique features it
        developed over its evolution; I like to think that my own diverse
        background and ability to adapt makes me a similarly interesting and
        well-rounded (if perhaps a little odd) <span class="line-through"

      I currently work at Stellar Elements (originally Big Nerd Ranch when I
      joined in 2018), where I've worked with clients ranging from 2-person
      start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. My current project has me building a
      React + Typescript component library and design system for a nationwide
      fast food company.
