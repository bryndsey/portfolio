  `Growing up, I didn't have a computer at home. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I had never written any computer code until my time at Centre College. I was originally a Math major there, but after accidentally stumbling into a few encounters with coding, I fell in love with it and somehow managed to graduate in 2012 with a degree in Computer Science.`,
  `The first few years of my career were also spent fumbling around but landing in places where I could learn and grow. I did enterprise desktop development with C++ and worked on an "ERP" system using... X++ (yeah, don't ask).`,
  `My curiosity drove me to evolve though. After taking some random advice from a co-worker, I taught myself Android development and in 2015 landed a job doing it professionally. In addition to working with a new tech stack, I also adapted from working at a product company to consulting. During that time, I was also exposed to books like "Clean Code", evolving my technical skills to "Senior Developer" status.`,
  `Fast-forward to 2019, and a chance encounter with React led me to learning it in my free time, and I later made the switch to full-time web developer. As time has gone on, I've continued to inherit new skills and tools, some of which you can see on display on this website as well as in my projects (and some of which I can't share... NDAs, sorry ðŸ˜”).`,

        <p>
          I'm a software engineer<span class="text-stone-500">*</span> focused on
          front-end web development. I've picked up a wide set of skills over my
          career, both technical and non-technical, and continue to adapt effectively
          to new environments and technologies. My favorite animal is the platypus.

        fur instead of feathers. It's got a tail like a beaver. The playtpus took
        a unique evolutionary path to get to where it is today.

      Am I forcing a metaphor because "platypus" is my favorite animal? Perhaps.
      But, I genuinely think the platypus is a beautiful, intriguing, and
      sometimes underappreciated creature because of the unique features it
      developed over its evolution; I like to think that my own diverse
      background and ability to adapt to a variety of environments makes me a
      similarly interesting and well-rounded (if perhaps a little odd) <span

      I currently work at Stellar Elements (originally Big Nerd Ranch when I
      joined in 2018), where I've worked with clients ranging from 2-person
      start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. My current project has me building a
      React + Typescript component library and design system for a nationwide
      fast food company.
